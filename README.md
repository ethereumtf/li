Help otehr people and win big with lotto for social impact. 

New concept of Universal Basic Income.

## Description

ETHGlobal Lonodn project.

"Good Deed Lotto for Social Impact."


Universal basic income requires large amounts of financial resources.

There are ways to raise funds through government funds or institutional donations, but these are limited to countries or communities.

On the other hand, there are many good participants around the world who want to personally contribute to the community and donate even small amounts.

Therefore, in order to provide universal basic income to those in need around the world, we have proposed a completely new method of Lotto Impact.
